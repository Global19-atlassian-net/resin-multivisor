# Resin Multivisor

**WORK IN PROGRESS, do not use in production devices**

This is [resin.io](https://resin.io)'s Multivisor, a program that runs on IoT devices and has the task of running user Apps (which are Docker containers), and updating them as Resin's API informs it to. It is a fork of [Resin Supervisor](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-supervisor), adapted to run as a Resin app and to be able to run multiple app containers.

For now it's only for amd64 (e.g. Intel NUC) devices.
